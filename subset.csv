In Stan's staff meeting this morning he asked we let you know of any vacancies that are being filled.  I have two that are currently in process: 
*	Director, Financial Planning -recruiting internally and externally on a concurrent basis due primarily to Omaha location,  preference given to internal candidates.
*	Financial Planning Analyst (Ben Humann's vacancy) - recruiting internally only.

For either of these positions I think Enron should be willing to pay relocation if necessary (to avoid severance costs).  From the standpoint of the partnerships I don't think NBP should pay this cost since there are plenty of local candidates from which to choose."

Subject: Re: Herald Oil & Gas Jan Actuals  

For Herald Oil & Gas, I will set up the meters on the deal with deducts and 
OOGEEP, and get the actual volumes in.  Unify will calculate the difference. 
We will pay them on actuals from here on out.  I paid them originally because 
Herald was in that stack of producers we ""create""an invoice for.

Power Gas and Phillips were paid yesterday (money going out today).  Kathy 
Kelly and Chris Germany set up some buy/sell deals so we could pay them and 
bill CES.  I gave them a list of similar deals for T & F, Questa, Phoenix 
Dominion.  

I got a call from Jim Spear at CNG Field Services for some CPA gas for 
January.  I left him a message to send me the invoice he previously sent to 
CES.  I'll get a deal set up and refer it to Kathy and Chris to finsh their

For Richard Burkland and William S Burkland (both CPA), I have no 
information.  Can you supply any ?

They are still trying to get transport contracts set up for the various pipes 
for ""CES"" production in order to be able to path and track and balance all of 
these meters we have entered on deals.  I am sending Global Facilities a list 
of meters for initial set up in the system, meters for tax codes to be set, 
and I will be putting the OOGEEP deducts on the deals.  And last but not 
least, I am setting up and assigning statement groups (a list of parties with 
no payment addresses set up is going out to Global Counter Party shortly) so 
I can draft these statements after the volumes are put in.

In between,I am setting up some spreadsheets for CNG, CGAS, and Gatherco 
information we have received to help track payments and information. 

I need some assistance with the pricing for Kenoil , RB Robertson, Cutter 
Oil, and a question on Oxford.  Please give me a call today when you can.

Attached is the updated (as of Wednesday) spreadsheet of CES Appalachian 
Deals.

Thanks  WRP

Attached is a draft of the Vega VaR implement documentation.  We will discuss 
this issue tomorrow.

Index VaR and the Vega VaR status:
Because any modification of the VaR model has to be coded into the new 
version by IT,  the Index VaR model and the Vega VaR model are on the waiting 
list to get into  IT group's door.  Currently, they are struggling with the 
Credit Model.  Accord to Jonathan Le, they will implement the ""Prudency"" 
model after the ""Credit"" and before anything else.  So, it's uncertain when 
they can begin these two projects.

Credit Reserve Model status:
New version developed by IT is still in the debugging stage.  Two major 
difference exist between the new and old versions:
1)  Old version uses delta-gammar methodology, new version uses full 
evaluation.  IT group is not comfortable with their implementation of the 
""Spread option"" and ""Swaption"" evaluation.  I am working with them on it.
2) Insurance projects are new to the new version.  IT also wants our help too.

Only after the IT finishes the debugging process, could we start testing the 
new version with the current one.

Thanks.

HANOVER -- Bertelsmann, the global media corporation,

with capital holdings targeted at DM 2.2 billion
($1 billion). The new fund, eBertelsmann, will become
the largest fund investing in media and the Internet
in Europe, according to the company. The company

technology markets, in the development of new services

divisions instead of operating separately as a multimedia
wing. Venture capital activities within Bertelsmann
include Bertelsmann Ventures, Venturepark Incubator,

A Perspective on Enron from the Inside
By Anonymous

The nightmare known as Enron is almost over for me.  The escape hatch
will finally open when six hundred or so of us are transferred to UBS
Warburg within the next week.  Without a doubt, we are among the most
fortunate souls in this debacle.  After all, we not only kept our jobs
but we also will transition seamlessly to a new entity with no
interruption in pay or benefits.  Even still, the conclusion of our
being collectively held hostage to a paycheck or employment contract
comes none too soon.  While no one does, nor should they, feel sorry for
us; this effective escape from Enron marks the end of what will now be,
at best, a rather embarrassing entry on our resumes.

Disabled Military Retirees... The Forgotten Americans
By Thomas D. Segel

It is well known we have more lobbyists in Washington than we have
elected officials.  One could almost charge that if the lobbyists
marching on Capital Hill came to a quick halt, there would be a chain
reaction collision all the way to the Potomac River.  Lobbying abounds
for almost every issue in this country.....except the disabled military
retiree forced to pay his or her own disability payments.  Sadly, these
men and women who gave so completely of themselves to defend every
American are without a voice to really be heard by Congress.  This is
wrong.  The disabled military retirees should have the most powerful
lobby of all....every citizen of the United States of America.

Diagramming Sentences and Other Lost Arts
By Linda Chavez

Maybe I was just an odd kid, but one of my favorite childhood pastimes
was diagramming sentences. I hadn't thought about diagramming in years,
until I read recently about a teacher in Gaithersburg, Md., who has
re-introduced the lost art into her Advanced Placement English classes
in the high school where she teaches.

Winning Drug War Requires Tough Love
By Marc Levin

A controversial Super Bowl ad linking drug abuse and terrorism has
served as a reminder that approximately seven times as many Americans
die each year from illegal drugs as were murdered on September 11.
However, from Ralph Nader to William F. Buckley, many critics advocate
drug legalization.  Their argument is that people have the right to
consume any substance so long as others are not directly harmed. Of
course, there is no such right in the U.S. Constitution.

The Gipper Makes History Again
By Mike Bayham

One of the nation's most obscure holidays has to be President's Day.
The holiday was created by Congress in 1968 to consolidate Washington
and Lincoln's birthdays into one holiday and while paying homage the
great and the not so great occupants of the oval office.  Because of
this streamlining historical giants like the aforementioned are now
""honored"" on the same day as Taylor, Tyler, Hayes and William Henry
Harrison who lasted thirty days.

The Israeli Spy Flap Will Fade Away, But At What Cost?
By Douglas J. Brown

Just as the discovery of 27 listening devices in President Jiang Zemin's
new Boeing plane is not likely to outwardly damage US-China ties,
reports of Israeli spy rings in the US are not likely to have a
noticeable effect on US-Israeli relations. At least, not outwardly.

*** Re: Hey Media, Leave The Kids Alone (Mike Bayham)

This article is what I have been thinking all along. It is really a
shame that we can't just let people have a personal life anymore no
matter who they are.
-- Melinda Moore, Springfield, Missouri

The media has hated Bush from day one and will use anyone or anything to
get at him. Please tell me one news channel on ABC, CBS, NBC or CNN or
even C-Span that don't lean the democratic way! Maybe the republican
party can boycott watching these news outlets for awhile and see how
their ratings go down! I'd for one be happy to!

Quick Research Tips for Discovering Your Family Story:
START WITH WHAT YOU ALREADY KNOW
=================================================================

When you're first starting out, collecting information about your
ancestors may seem like an enormous task. But you may already know
much of the information about your close relatives.

TO GET STARTED:
1. The best place to start collecting information is with the most
recent generation. This may be you, your children, or perhaps your
grandchildren.

2. Record the basic genealogical information that you know about
your close relatives:
     *Full names
     *Birth dates and birthplaces
     *Marriage dates and marriage places
     *Death dates and death places, if applicable

3. Take these facts and enter them into your family tree software or
other documentation source.

4. When you have collected information about yourself and any younger
generations, then start working backwards with your parents,
grandparents, and so on, as far back as you can remember.

Subject: Take me out to the ...

Oh wait, I can't go to the ball game because I couldn't take a day off from 
work to stand in the Enron lobby (or send my secretary to do it for me).  

For all of you who have managed to snag tickets for tonight's game 
congratulations and you suck.  For the rest of us stuck out in the cold I 
suggest the only viable alternative before us is to drown our sorrows in a 
cold bottle of beer (or two, or three...).  I realize the mass email has been 
MIA the last two weeks.  For some this may have been a welcomed relief.  For 
others there may have been some concern that they had been cut-off from the 
distribution.  At present no one has been removed from the distribution, but 
it is undergoing an audit.  Should it be determined that it is necessary to 
remove an individual from the list for any reason that individual will be 
notified and given an explanation.  If anyone would like to know the causes 
for expulsion you can write to:  I CAN'T BELIEVE ANYONE CARES IF THERE ON 
THIS DISTRIBUTION OR NOT BECAUSE THE ONLY PLACE WE SEEM TO GO IS WOODY'S 
EVERY THURSDAY BETWEEN 9:30 AND 10:00.

On that note, see you guys at Woody's tonight around 9:30 or 10:00.

We have discovered another problem that we may want to discuss in our oral 
comments, although the UDCs may cover it.  Even though the FERC removes the 
forward market prohibition, the UDCs will not be in the forward market 
because: (1) the PUC may find they were imprudent and (2) the FERC's penalty 
is only for underscheduling load in the day-ahead or the day-of market, not 
for load failing to be hedged in the forward market."

NFL Reports, Player Updates

Latest NFL Player News

Tim Brown <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=1267&>, WR OAK - Martin Updated 12/02/01
Brown had a solid game, catching five passes for 63 yards and two scores against Arizona. With Jerry Rice on the other side of the field, Brown is having one of the best season of his illustrious career. 

Rich Gannon <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=1034&>, QB OAK - Martin Updated 12/02/01
Gannon threw for 302 yards and three scores against Arizona. He did throw two picks as well, but he's still an elite Fantasy quarterback. 

David Boston <http://footba! ll! 299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=133230&>, WR ARI - Bass/Hull Updated 12/02/01
Boston had another great game, catching six passes for 106 yards and a touchdown against Oakland. Boston continues to be one if the best wide receivers in Fantasy Football. 

Michael Pittman <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=12623&>, RB ARI - Matty Updated 12/02/01
Pittman had a solid game, posting 93 all-purpose yards and a touchdown against Oakland. He's been inconsistent as a Fantasy player, however, and is best used when the matchup is right.

Tony Martin <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&ran! do! m=718&key=1282&>, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/02/01
Martin caught six passes for 97 yards against the Rams. The veteran wideout has seen better days, though, and he is not a reliable Fantasy wideout. He will occasionally post respectable numbers, but he will also have many quiet weeks.

Bob Christian <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=1077&>, RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/02/01
Christian rushed one time for five yards against St. Louis and caught four passes for 16 yards. He became a minor factor in the game as the Falcons fell behind early. Christian is still worth a reserve spot on any Fantasy roster.

Marshall Faulk <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.! 2&! random=718&key=1109&>, RB STL - Matty Updated 12/02/01
In addition to 70 rushing yards, Faulk caught six passes for 128 yards and three TDs. There seems to be no way of containing the best back in Fantasy Football. 

Kurt Warner <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=12797&>, QB STL - Hunter Updated 12/02/01
Warner bounced back from a forgettable Week 11 performance by tearing up the Falcons for 342 yards, four TDs and no interceptions. There should be little doubt that he is still capable of taking any Fantasy team to a championship this year.




Shaun Alexander! , RB SEA - JWillie Updated 12/02/01Alexander rushed for 87 yards and a TD against the Chargers. Defenses are stacking their fronts against Alexander, but he is still managing to score enough to be a must-start player for any Fantasy team. <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=187382&>Matt Hasselbeck <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 12/02/01
Hasselbeck threw for 202 yards, no TDs and no interceptions against the Chargers. While he has certainly cut down on his mistakes, Hasselbeck doesn't challenge defenses downfield and he doesn't deserve a spot on most Fantasy rosters.

Curtis Conway <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=1204&>, ! WR! SD - Giggles Updated 12/02/01
Conway caught three passes for just 34 yards at Seattle. Still, he has remained healthy this year and should be a solid Fantasy wideout during these important final weeks.

Doug Flutie <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=12375&>, QB SD - Russell Updated 12/02/01
The Seahawks held Flutie to 195 passing yards, no TD passes and intercepted him twice. The veteran QB has been a disappointment for most of the year and he will not be a dependable Fantasy player in the final weeks of the season.

Stephen Davis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=1440&>, RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 12/02/01! 
Davis had only 53 yards rushing on 17 carries against Dallas on Sunday. He continues to have a mediocre season, which makes it tough for Fantasy owners to start him every week. 

Tony Banks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/02/01
Banks had a mediocre game, throwing for 216 yards with one score and an interception against Dallas. He is no better than a reserve on your Fantasy team. 

Raghib Ismail <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=1201&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/02/01
Ismail had a big game for Dallas, catching three passes for 93 ya! rd! s and a touchdown against Washington. Ismail has easily been Dallas' most consistent receiver, but he's still a gamble for Fantasy owners. 

Emmitt Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 12/02/01
Smith had his best game of the season, rushing for 102 yards and a touchdown on 25 carries vs. Washington. If coach Dave Campo gives him enough carries, Smith still has the talent and experience to be a productive Fantasy player.

Eddie Kennison <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=1296&>, WR DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/02/01
The Kansas City Chiefs are reportedly interested in Kennison. The team is expected to bring the wideout in for an interview and a physical as early as Monday, with the intent of signing him. 

Terry Hardy <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=12423&>, TE ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/02/01
Hardy suffered an apparent knee injury during Sunday's game against Oakland. He did not return to the contest. 

Chris Chandler <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=1004&>, QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/02/01
Chandler suffered a sprained left ankle in the second quarter of Sunday's game against St. Louis. He was replaced by Michael Vick.! 

Troy Brown <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=1253&>, WR NE - Bass/Hull Updated 12/02/01
Brown caught eight passes for 59 yards at New York. The flashy New England wideout has not reached the 100-yard receiving mark in his last six games.

David Patten <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=1790&>, WR NE - JWillie Updated 12/02/01
Patten caught six passes for 60 yards at New York. He will be an occasionally spectacular, yet inconsistent wideout during the final weeks of the Fantasy season.

Santana Moss <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=2352! 34! &>, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 12/02/01
Moss caught two passes for 40 yards against New England. The rookie receiver has already injected new life into the New York passing game, but he won't do enough statistically to help Fantasy owners.

Laveranues Coles <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=187742&>, WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 12/02/01
Coles caught three passes for 63 yards and a TD against New England. The New York wideout has quickly emerged as his team's top receiver.

Stephen Alexander <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=12181&>, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/02/01
Alexander left Sunday's game against Dallas in the second quarter due to an ankle injury. His return to the game is questionable. 

Obafemi Ayanbadejo <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=1869&>, RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 12/02/01
Ayanbadejo caught a five-yard TD pass and scored on a nine-yard run against the Colts. He will be a regular goal-line threat for the RB-starved Ravens during the final weeks of the NFL regular season.

Moe Williams <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=1481&>, RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 12/02/01
Williams rushed for 111 yards and caught three passes for 27 yards against the Colts. Williams, who also lost a fumble, took advantage of a leaky Colts defense, and he still has to prove he can perform well on a regular basis.

Marcus Pollard <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=1335&>, TE IND - Free Agent Updated 12/02/01
Pollard caught four passes for 80 yards and a TD at Baltimore. Right now, he is arguably the most reliable TE in Fantasy Football.

Dominic Rhodes <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=236986&>, RB IND - Free Agent Updated 12/02/01
Rhodes rushed for 42 yards and caught six passes for 25 yards, but he fumble! d ! twice. The physical Ravens' defense kept him off balance, yet Rhodes should still be a dependable Fantasy RB during the next few weeks.

Hines Ward <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=12795&>, WR PIT - Tori Updated 12/02/01
The Vikings held Ward to three catches for 37 yards. Expect him to rebound quickly from his quiet performance.

Plaxico Burress <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=187385&>, WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/02/01
Burress caught six passes for 86 yards against Minnesota. The second-year man is looking better as a route runner and mid-range receiver.

Subject: Updated EOL Customer profiles

Frank:

We have recently rethought our treatment of some of our Western 
counterparties.  Originally, if a Western CP traded power in the West under 
the WSPP Agreement, we permitted the CP to enter into Enron Sales only for 
Eastern power pursuant to the on-line GTCs.  However, we have decided that 
certain of such CPs should not be permitted to trade Eastern power at all.  
Accordingly, please revise the profile for the CPs listed below so that they 
cannot buy or sell Eastern power products via EOL:

Arizona Public Service Company
Avista Corporation - Washington Water Power Division
British Columbia Power Exchange Corporation
California Department of Water Resources
City of Redding
Colorado Springs Utilities
Idaho Power Company
Los Angeles Department of Water & Power
Nevada Power Company
Northern California Power Agency
Pacificorp
Public Service Company of Colorado
Public Service Company of New Mexico
Sacremento Municipal Utility District
Salt River Project Agricultural Improvement and Power District
San Diego Gas & Electric Company
Seattle City Light
Sierra Pacific Power Company
St. Joseph Light & Power Co.
Tucson Electric Power Company

If any of these CPs have previously traded any Eastern power products, please 
let me know at your earliest convenience so that I can address this issue.

Please note that this change should not affect the ability of these CPs to 
trade Western power products.

Thanks:

Leslie

rules to a game:
You flip a coin. If you get tails you win 0.  if you get heads, i give you
$1.  Keep flipping until you get a tails, at which point you walk away with
the money.  however, each heads you get after the first you double your
money.  So if you flip heads 3 times and then tails, you get $4.  What's
you bid/offer on playing this game?  (would you pay $.5 to play? $1? $2?
what you charge me play against you?)

Ben - did I correctly read the last transitional heading ""Deal Maker"".  
Further, did I correctly not see my name listed in BOLD next to this item.  
For shame.  For your info, PRC is over.....you can stop kissing Don's butt.

Hi Debbie, hate to bother you but I know that for physicals we built the interface to Global Contracts from RA to do this so EOL customers would only have to sign their GTC's once.  How did this work for financials, was it from a Tagg feed?  Do you have any info on this I can send to Ron as I do not want to have to recreate the wheel on this one?  Thanks Cindy

Subject:	Issue to be resolved and acted upon

Workflow in DCAF II for Global Products will require a number of changes to the Way DCAF II currently works.

When a deal is received by DCAF II from MoneyPenney, DCAF II will have to determine if the deal is to be confirmed and who the confirming party is on the deal.

DCAF II determines this by taking a contract number assigned to the deal and goes to Global Contracts.  The Contract identifies who is to confirm the deal.  

Issue:  Currently MoneyPenny does not capture Global Compliant Contract Numbers.  Cindy Horn indicated her understanding is that Global Product Deals traded on EOL have a Contract Number.  While it is true that a party may agree to a GTC when logging on to EOL,  it does not mean that there  is a contract set up in Global Contracts between the parties.   My understanding is that EOL stores a Global Compliant Contract Number for those parties that have Master Agreements with Enron recorded in Global Contracts.  When a deal is traded on EOL for these parties,  the Contract Number ( e.g., 96053367 ) is provided in the XML message sent to Sitara and MoneyPenney.    This needs to be verified.

I have had discussions with Tim Legget regarding the contract number issue and he suggests the following be done.  A buyer contract and a seller contract number edit fields will be provided in the MoneyPenney Capture windows.  The reason there is a buyer and seller contract number is because there are two contracts when internal parties trade with each other.  MoneyPenney will not require a contract number be entered.  When MoneyPenney sends the deal message to DCAF II via DriveTrain, DriveTrain will try to determine the contract number using the GKCOM service that was developed for this purpose.  The problem with this is that there may be a significant number of deals where this service cannot determine the contract for.  GKCOM uses the internal party, the external party, the product, the document type (e.g., Master Purchase Sale Firm ), the start and end date of the deal to try and find a contract.  

First of all,  who is going to tell GKCOM what kind of Contract Agreement to look for.  There a gazillion different types of contract agreements.   If MoneyPenney does not know what contract is covering the deal, how would it know to tell GKCOM what contract agreement type to look for?

Second,  a contract has to exist which matches the product on the deal.  There are a gazillion products traded in the Global Products world.  Every product has to be set up ( See ** ) under the contract that the counterparty could possibly trade.   Also,  there may be a need to set up several contracts for the same party.  Remember, DCAF II looks to the contract to determine who is confirming the deal.  For London deals, if the deal is  Petchems or MTBE, Enron confirms.  For some products, if it is a Brokered sale, then the Broker confirms - if it is a Brokered Purchase from Stasco, BP, Texaco, or Exxon/Mobile, then the Counterparty confirms - For all other Liquids, a Brokered Purchase is confirmed by the Broker.  Currently,  it is impossible to implement these business rules in Global Contracts.  Global Contracts does not have the ability to indicate 
that the broker is confirming if it is brokered versus someone else if the deal is not brokered.

**  You can  indicate in Global Contracts that the product is ""Any"".  But ""Any"" could conflict with contracts that need to be set for Gas, Power, and Industrial Markets.  That is, you can't indicate to Global Contracts that ""Any"" means ""Any Global Product"" ;""Any"" means ""anything"".  

OK, so it is very likely that GKCOM cannot  provide a contract for all deals.  If that is the case, then the transaction will be kicked out - will not get to DCAF II - until someone becomes aware that the deal kicked out of DriveTrain and determines what the contract is and enters it into MoneyPenney.  If this happens, it is unlikely that the confirm will go out within 24 hours.  

Even if a contract is determined by DriveTrain,   there will a significant number of deals for which the confirming party designation is not correct.

Please note that TAGG does not use contract numbers.  As such,  someone has to eyeball every deal and determine who is confirming the deal and if Enron is, which template format out of the hundreds available should be used.  The value in  DCAF can only be realized if the ""someone"" is removed from the processing. 

Bottom Line:  DCAF II  needs a way to determine who the confirming party is on every deal, the correct Governing Law, Arbitration,  and Jurisdiction .  For gas deals ,  the contract provides the relevant information.  The Global Products world is much more complicated.  

Decision:  If DCAF II is to use Global Contracts, there needs to be a project staffed by one or more persons 	      who spend the next couple of months working on the following responsibilities:

	1)	Determining and implementing  what upgrades to Global Contracts are required to support 
		Global Products

	2)	Making sure that the appropriate contracts are set up for all Houston and London trading 
		partners. 

	3)	Defining the business rules required to populate  the XML message with the appropriate 
		Contract Agreement Type  needed by GKCOM to determine the contract number.

	4)	 Defining a procedure that is executed when the deal kicks out of DriveTrain to determine what 
		the contract on the deal should be and enable it to be entered into MoneyPenny.

Subject: Intergen/Coral transaction

Randy:

As I indicated in my voicemail, Coral has requested that Intergen (or its 
designated project affiliate - Sweetgum Energy L.P.) be the counterparty that 
transacts with Enron.  Based on current information, the structure of the 
transaction has not materially changed from the Coral deal structure 
described in the 11/30/00 DASH.  Intergen is holding a Board meeting this 
afternoon and the proposed transaction is on the agenda for approval.

With regard to the timing of the funding, it is my understanding that once 
the Letter Agreement has been executed (target date: 12/21) and associated 
documents accepted by Intergen, Enron will notify TurboPark of its intention 
to assign the equipment to Intergen (target notice date: 12/22).  Once the 
assignment documents are ready for execution, Intergen will fund the 
transaction and Enron will execute the assignment documents immediately after 
receiving written confirmation that Enron has received the transaction 
proceeds.  There is a desire by East Origination to, if possible, book the 
earnings from this transaction in fiscal year 2000.

Rebecca Walker (ENA development) is planning to run a D&B report on Sweetgum 
Energy L.P.  tomorrow once she receives the State and Headquarters 
information necessary.  I traded voicemails with Ben Glisan today on this 
counterparty change.  He asked that I work with RAC deal personell on this 
matter. 

Based upon your voicemail it appears that we do not need to amend the DASH 
based upon this change in counterparty.  Let me know if any of the above 
information changes your opinion.  

Call me if you wish to discuss this information.

Thanks,
Fred Mitro

The request to have all currently performing deals moved to the East Performance and West Performance books has just been expressed as URGENT.  

As soon as the East Performance and West Performance books are set up in Global, we will need Enpower refreshed ASAP.  

Bill H. is coordinating the setup in global, Dave/Crooks are coordinating the script to be run to change the primary desk name.  

If anyone has any questions at all, PLEASE let me know.  Thanks to all and sorry for the fire drill!

Teams,
As of this morning Critical notices and Cut notices started going out to customers. Both web sites are now available, the Omaha site is still the best one for customers to log into, the Houston site is still pretty slow but can be used if needed.

Omaha (www.hottap.enroncorp.com
Houston (www.hottap.enron.com

The Team EDI is still not available so before each nomination and confirmation deadline contact Mary Draemer or Jim Studebaker to fined out if EDI transactions have cleared the EDI Hub. 

Please continue to be proactive in helping our customers with nominations, confirmations and scheduled quantities information. 
There is still no estimated time as to when internal employees will have access to the internet.

I wanted to clarify our game plan for the next couple of weeks.

1.  Tomorrow a meeting is taking place with FuelCells to resolve some major 
outstanding business issues.  At this meeting, the point is going to be made 
that in order to maintain the desired schedule, FCE is going to have to 
increase its technical effort.  Presently, we are concerned that the 
technical aspects of the purchase order are not in sufficient order to 
finalize a purchase order by next week (we want to make certain that our deal 
with FuelCells is largely defined before we make a state filing).  We are 
going to emphasize to FCE that both sides need to devote their technical 
resources to this goal.  One of our priorities is to bring the technical 
portions of the purchase order up to the level necessary to finalize an 
order.  I need the Tony Leo list today so I can show FuelCells all the 
information that they owe us before this meeting.

2.  We have redrafted the purchase order.  However, the P.O. needs refinement 
to reflect the resolution of the outstanding business terms and to make 
certain that the technical information and procedures are clearly defined 
(much of the information that I sent you).  Given 1) the proposed payment 
mechanics and 2) FCE's lack of mature documents, we are concerned that FCE 
will try to get by with loose technical language to avoid acceptance and 
ultimately payment issues.  Also, we are concerned that once we make our 
state filing that our negotiating leverage with FCE will go down. One of our 
major focuses jobs between now and 11/3/00 is to make certain that the 
technical sections of the P.O. are properly defined.

3.  With regard to the BOP cost estimates, I would like to get the revised 
estimates no later than tomorrow.  Our current plan is to make a state filing 
(CRRA will make the filing and the filing will be the source of the funding)  
which clearly defines our basic assumptions in coming up with these estimates 
(we will not show the complete estimates) and to show conservative ranges.  
You will be given the opportunity to review and comment on the cost and 
technical information provided in the filing.  A draft of the filing is to be 
sent to CRRA by 11/3.  Given this approach, it is less important that we go 
to the sites next week.  Our focus should be on getting the purchase order 
into shape (from a technical point of view) and making sure that the state 
filing is accurate as to our base technical assumptions.

4.  The state filing is expected to be made by CRRA in the subsequent week.

Please give me a call if you have any questions."

There are several unit contingent deals that don't have the unit name in the 
comment section.  Can you have them put in this information.  I know you sent 
us a reference sheet, but I think it would be better if the trader would 
specify the unit in the comment section.

Also, there was a deal on the no report this morning that looked to us like 
it probably should be confirmed.  Can you take a look at it and let me know?

Attached is a draft of the CA for Peoples based on Gregg Penman's informati=

(and I could not find an example).

By the way, I used another People's CA I got from Ed's directory as an=20
example because it seemed to fit better than the one I got from you on Frid=

Gregg wanted some pretty specific reference to the confidential data being=

Please let me know what I need to change.

Kay - We have previously discussed the idea of a CA to specifically cover t=

prepare a CA for the distribution of enovate curves to specific individuals=

Basis and Index curves will be provided daily for all points at which enova=

the risk management area.  (Individuals should be named on a schedule).
Curves are being provided for the express purpose of independent risk=20

In return, the specific individuals will not forward, copy, or otherwise=20

enovate GM or the Enron designated enovate risk committee member regarding=

I need some language regarding audit rights, but this should get you=20

I am currently working on a new ISDA wherein the counterparty is a US sub of 
a foreign Guarantor.  Upon consulting with Rhett Jackson in Tax, he thought 
we needed to work a form of the tax reps into the guaranty since the 
Guarantor was foreign.  I see the same issue arising in respect of certain 
other amendments on which I am working.  Rhett is looking over this matter 
now and I will advise.    Any thoughts?

Peter:

I asked Mark T to give you a call.  Legal questions on the financial confirms 
should be handled in Canada as the first option and secondly go to Houston.  
Please talk it through with Mark T to make sure that all works.  Should you 
and Mark T talk it through with the confirm desk in Canada to make sure it is 
clear?

Regards,

Mark Haedicke

SENT ON BEHALF OF PETER KEOHANE:

Please see attached e-mail from Rob Milnthorp.  What I believe he is 
referring to is documentation of financial (gas or power transactions).  
(i.e. All physical transactions, Confirms, GTC's, Masters, etc. are 
documented out of Calgary, all with the proper controls.)  Honestly, I am not 
clear on this point.  My understanding is that responsibility for financial 
trading for Canada is with Mark Taylor.  i.e. I understand that Confirms 
which do not require legal input have been moved to the Confirm group in 
Calgary, but Confirms which require legal input, ISDA Masters with Canadian 
counterparties, structured financial transactions, etc. remain with Mark 
Taylor, and that Calgary Legal is not, generally speaking, responsible for 
financial transactions.  I do not want to re-visit this issue, but merely 
clarify any confusion so that I can get back to Milnthorp.  I know that 
neither Greg Johnston, Mark Powell, Chris Gaffney nor I are seeing any 
financial trades.

Regards,
Peter

If so, can you please explain them to me. I'm still confused following my

Subject: Physical Power GTC

Please find attached the form of physical power GTC that may be used in 
conjunction with confirms for power deals of less than one year in duration.  
This is the standard form so it does not address market opening delays or 
changes in law affecting pricing.  Any provisions required to address these 
risks will need to be built into the confirms themselves as ""Other 
Provisions"".

20 masters out or going out for signature does not make for SIGNED

For those of you keeping track, Carrizo makes 475 master swap agreements.  
Conferring with Team Swap, we have at least 20 masters out or going out for 
sigature this week (including the 9 Merit Energy Partner masters).  Unlike 
the media in the Presidential Election, I hesitate to call this one an early 
win (especially after seeing the Board in Marie's office!), but I must say, 
Team Swap is looking strong.

Attached is an e-mail containing revisions and additions El Paso recommends be
made to SoCalGas' draft Exhibit 28 which was distributed for further comment 
to
parties on June 16, 2000.  This e-mail has two attachments.  The first 
attachment
is a revised copy of SoCalGas' table titled ""Firm Pipeline Capacity into 
Southern
California"" with changes to:  (a) correct the amount of firm interstate 
capacity on
El Paso at Topock, shown in the col. ""Incoming Interstate Capacity,"" by 
replacing
the incorrect figure, 2230 MMcfd (which includes capacity for delivery to SW 
Gas
which is not available to California on a firm basis) with the correct 
figure,  2080
MMcfd; (b) delete the reference to El Paso delivery capacity to SW Gas from 
the
col. ""Total Take-away Capacity"" since this capacity is not firm capacity 
available
to California; (c) adjust the totals at the bottom of both cols. affected by 
these
changes; (d) add a new footnote to reference to the fact that shippers on El 
Paso
have existing firm contract rights for delivery from El Paso at Topock to 
SoCalGas
totaling 1466 MMcfd which exceeds SoCalGas' take-away capacity at Topock
and clearly creates a ""mismatch""; and (c) add reference in footnote (2) to the
physical capacity of Kern/Mojave at the interconnection with SoCalGas at
Wheeler Ridge South, which is in excess of 680 MMcfd even though the metering
is currently set to 500 MMcfd.   The second attachment contains two schematics
intended to supplement SoCalGas' draft map of receipt points and
interconnections.  These schematics more accurately reflect the actual 
physical
interconnections at Topock and Hector Ridge and correct both the inaccurate
impression that the interconnect with  El Paso at Topock consists of several
separate pipelines with no cross over, and that inaccurate impression that 
several
interconnections may exist between pipelines at Hector Road .   El Paso
understands and acknowledges that there are a number of possible responses to
Administrative Law Judge Biren's request for a late filed exhibit concerning
""mismatches"" and pipeline capacity upstream and downstream from SoCalGas
receipt points.  In the spirit of compromise, El Paso  will not oppose 
SoCalGas
filing an exhibit as proposed 6/16/00 provided it is revised to reflect the 
changes
and additions El Paso has proposed in this e-mail.   Very truly yours, Edward

Subject:	Communication Alternatives in Crisis/Disaster/Outage Situations

In Shelley's staff meeting this morning, she expressed concern about situations (like the one we are currently experiencing) in regard to e-mail and electronic communication channel availability to customers.  Unfortunately, much of the last 24 hour's issues have been driven by poor and incomplete information coming from the corporate team.  In addition, we have suffered our own internal communication challenges.  With that said, she identified two critical areas that she wants to resolve in the short term;  

1.)  An efficient e-mail distribution capability that is not dependent on Enron firewall access.  Although messages were successfully sent to customers yesterday, the process was cumbersome and time consuming.  A process that can handle the complete distribution list and/or segmentation of messages (ie by pipeline) is needed.  The service should be available from remote locations.  I am currently investigating this issue.  (i.e. bulk mail handler and reliability via outside ISP source.) 

2.)  A communication diagnostic tool that is not dependent on corporate team information.  There should be the ability to test our communication abilities/processes to external parties.  The tool should address what customers can access, whether they can receive messages, etc.  Again it should have remote capabilities. 

I would characterize the goals of addressing these issues to be that ETS knows what its current electronic communication situation is and that it is accurately communicating it to customers.  

Alma will set up a meeting to discuss ASAP.  Alma, please invite those on the ""To"" distribution.
