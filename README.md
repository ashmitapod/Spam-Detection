# Spam-Detection
A project to detect spam emails using Naive Bayes, NLP preprocessing, and TF-IDF

# Spam Detection Using Naive Bayes

This project uses **Naive Bayes** and **NLP** techniques to classify spam emails. It processes the **Enron email dataset**, performs text preprocessing, extracts features using **TF-IDF**, and trains a **Naive Bayes** classifier to identify spam emails.

## Steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the email data.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Use **TF-IDF** to convert text into numerical features.
3. **Model Training**: Train a **Naive Bayes** classifier.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the classifier's performance on the test data.

## Enron Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is the **Enron Email Dataset**, which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wcukierski/enron-email-dataset).
